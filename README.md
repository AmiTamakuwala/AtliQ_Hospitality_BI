AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the 
hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other 
competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its 
market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, 
the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data 
Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an 
in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights. 
Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to 
provide them with insights from their historical data.

1) Importing and verifying data. few transformations and cleaning in power query
2) Data modeling
3) Identifying & Creating Measures using DAX.
4) Validating all data
5) Creating Dashboard using appropriate Visualization.

with the help of DAX I created Calculated columns along with new measures for the Revenue , occupancy, Average ratings, successful Bookings, etc. 
How much revenue generated in the weekdays or weekend etc. we can see in the dashboard. 

All calculation, formula are mentioned in the given documnets.
